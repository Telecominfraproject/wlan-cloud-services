== Forwarding Agent Start On Abnormal AP condition ==

== Normal Termination Of Forwarding Agent when SSH Session is stopped ==
... **SSH session goes on** ...

dev_box -> dev_box : stop SSH session
dev_box -> fwd_gateway : disconnect socket
fwd_gateway -> fwd_gateway : detect SSH session disconnect
fwd_gateway -> equipment_and_network_status_ds: Stopped forwarding session\n on dev-ap-0001,\n User (certificate CN)=developer1
fwd_gateway -> system_event_ds: Stopped forwarding session\n on dev-ap-0001,\n User (certificate CN)=developer1 
fwd_gateway -> fwd_agent: send disconnect message via websocket
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: disconnect from local socket
dev_box -> dev_box: wait 3 sec
dev_box -> fwd_gateway: stop forwarding agent
fwd_gateway -> ce_gateway: stop forwarding agent
ce_gateway -> opensync: stop forwarding agent
opensync -> fwd_agent: stop
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: stop

== Behaviour of Forwarding Agent when websocket connection gets interrupted ==
... **SSH session goes on** ...

fwd_agent <-> fwd_gateway : broken socket connection
fwd_gateway -> fwd_gateway : detect websocket disconnect
fwd_gateway -> equipment_and_network_status_ds: Stopped forwarding session\n on dev-ap-0001,\n User (certificate CN)=developer1
fwd_gateway -> system_event_ds: Stopped forwarding session\n on dev-ap-0001,\n User (certificate CN)=developer1
fwd_gateway -> dev_box: disconnect SSH socket 
dev_box -> dev_box : drop SSH session

... **At the same time on AP side** ...

fwd_agent -> fwd_agent : detect websocket disconnect
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: disconnect from local socket
fwd_agent -> fwd_gateway: re-establish websocket connection
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: wait for new forwarding session

== Termination Of Forwarding Agent when idle timeout is triggered ==
fwd_agent -> fwd_gateway: establish websocket connection
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: wait for new forwarding session
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: No forwarding session \ncreated after N seconds
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: disconnect websocket 
fwd_agent -> fwd_agent: stop forwarding agent
